        text: "This review is long overdue. My son attended Aama Day Care for 1.5 yrs and I feel so fortunate that he got that time with Miss Rasu and her beautiful cohort of kids. If you are seeking an environment much like home where your child gets hands on care and attention, this is the place! Miss Rasu is compassionate and genuinely loves kids! I was also able to befriend many other parents and we still stay in touch. I'm forever grateful to Miss Rasu and her family for giving my son such a wonderful and fun experience!",

        text: "Miss Raasu is a natural with children. She is a very genuine caregiver who runs this business more out of passion than profession. What will stand out about her is that she never gives up on any child whom she accepts even if the child takes longer to adjust or is more demanding than usual. She is the epitome of patience and children mill around her like little moths, attracted to her composed and loving demeanor. In our case she accommodated our request of sibling admission even though my younger one was 6 months smaller than the age she admits children at. It was a huge relief for us, and we can never thank her enough for all the help she has extended and the safe and loving environment she has given both my kids. She also has a contemporary learning schedule which mixes free play and learning so seamlessly that kids strengthen their fundamentals while having fun at it. Wherever she stays is a boon for the families looking for a safe space for their children. I would trust her blindly when it comes to childcare.",

        text: "We started when my son was 16 months and he's now 5 and ready to graduate for kindergarten life. He learned so much during his stay, including writing his name, closing mouth when eating, hands are for caring, etc. Ms Rasu hosts once a year party, and it's such a hit for both kids and adults. We get to know the other parents and kids during the party and of course kids don't eat as they're having so much fun. We get updates on food, poop, sleep and behavior (food and bad) for the day. My son loves the treasure chest and sticker reward system. The last few years, I was happy we had a consistent group of kids that we saw from little one to walking / talking kids. It was nice to see their development and camaraderie. We got to know the kids and their families. It's bittersweet that we are graduating and will miss everyone.",

        text: "Aama daycare has been a godsend for my family!!! My son started going there since he was 1.5 years old until recently. Sadly we had to switch daycares as we relocated but I have such fond memories of this place! Ms. Rasu was so amazing in every aspect of my child's growth. It felt that every time he went there he learned something new! She went above and beyond to make sure that the kids are entertained and made learning so much fun!!! My kid was so excited to go to Ms. Rasu's every single day and it was so hard to make him come home lol. We surely are going to miss this place!!! Ms. Rasu has definitely made a huge impact in my child's life and I am eternally grateful to her!",
